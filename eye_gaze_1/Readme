The first scratch
*** eye_gaze_1 ***

The first scratch programe to detect ege gaze


*** Train ***

1. Screen was divided into 100 grids
2. images of the face while looking each of the grid were taken and named corresponding to the grid coordinates
3.the images were taken from the directory and gray scalled
4. using OpenCv the eyes were detected and the left eye was cropped and attached in a array 
5. the model was created with two columns having the lable in one column and the image of the left eye in the other column.

*** predict **

The video feed from the camera is taken as the input 

the left eye was cropped and crosschecked with the model and the sequential pattern prediction is has beeen made to predict the coordinates of the gaze.

the predicted coordinates were shown as a red dot in the frame itself.



Note : The accuracy of the system is very low as we jus used ine element the image and also as we used only the left eye image.
